Here at Nourish Net, we firmly feel that no college student should have to battle hunger on their own. We are committed to making sure that every college student in the busy academic hallways has access to the food they require to flourish. Come along with us as we fight hunger and build a better future for everybody.

# About Us

At Nourish Net, our journey began with a simple yet powerful belief: every student deserves a fair chance at success. Founded by passionate college women who witnessed firsthand the struggles of fellow students, we've made it our mission to tackle food insecurity head-on. With a team committed to making a difference, we're driven by compassion, determination, and the unwavering belief in the power of community.
